# PMS-Android-Application

Hello !

This application is designed to re-invent the project choosing and management process of final year university students and their supervisors.

The app uses a K-means clustering algorithm to suggest suitable projects to a user based off of individual interests the student has. Students also have the option to suggest their own project idea to potential supervisors.

Other features include:
  -  Kanban implementation
  -  Calendar
  -  Referencing guide
  -  Notification which can be created by supervisors for their students
  -  Messaging between supervisor and student
