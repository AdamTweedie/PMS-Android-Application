supervisor1@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor1,Investigating discourse in social media around climate change with data science and language processing,"Climate change is a critical challenge where cognitive and social interactions can greatly hamper or promote concrete interventions. This project aims at reviewing data science and natural language processing approaches for reconstructing how different groups of people report and discuss climate change. 
The data analysis for this project will adopt co-occurrence networks for testing how social media users discussed the #FridaysForFuture movement (dataset provided by the lecturer). Particular attention will be devoted to using computer science techniques for reconstructing the specific emotions surrounding ""climate change"" in social media.

supervisor1@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor1,Using complex networks for exploring the structure of mental walks in the human mind,"The human mind can store tens of thousands of concepts/ideas in an associative way, so that recalling one concept can also activate other related ideas. The recently released dataset “Small World of Words” captures these memory patterns, free of any specific definition, as a complex network of almost 50k words and over 400k links. 
This project aims at exploring how people naming as many animals as possible in 2 minutes (an animal category task, dataset provided by the lecturer) navigate through this large network structure based on their creativity level. What type of “mental walks” do creative people perform on the network of their memory? Network metrics will be used to compare the mental walks of people with high- and low creativity, like in (Stella and Kenett, 2019).

supervisor1@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor1,AI and multiplex networks for better understanding cognitive impairments like aphasia,"Aphasia is a spectrum of cognitive impairments where language production and/or understanding are impaired. This project will model human memory as a multiplex network, i.e. a network where the same set of words can be connected by either semantic associations or sound similarities. By considering the dataset from the Moss Aphasia Psycholinguistics Project, each word in the multiplex network will be attributed a probability for correct naming by people with 4 types of aphasia. These probabilities will then be used in order to progressively attack the multiplex network and thus quantify in a data-driven way how resilient human memory can be to progressive aphasic deterioration. 
The results will be discussed in line with the relevant literature from data science and the clinical sciences, also in view of potential innovative strategies for language restoration in people with aphasia.

supervisor3@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor3,Comparison of Bayesian Models – Machine Learning Going Back to Roots of Statistics Modelling,"Many statistical models especially Gaussian processes have been widely used for modelling (for both regression and classification) because of their ability to provide uncertainty in predictions in addition to point predictions. Many modern machine learning models e.g., neural networks and random forests have been popular, but they do not provide uncertainty in predictions. In this project, you will compare Bayesian machine learning models especially Bayesian neural networks, Bayesian random forests and Gaussian processes on the given data set. You will use theory of Bayesian statistics and apply it on neural networks and random forest. You will also validate these models on the unseen data set.

For instance, problems involving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation usually take substantial amount of time for one evaluation. Surrogate-assisted optimisation methods e.g., Bayesian optimisation have been used to solve such kinds of problems to alleviate the computation time. In this project, you will apply and compare different surrogate-assisted optimisation methods especially Bayesian optimisation methods on computational fluid dynamics and benchmark problems. Moreover, you will have the opportunity to apply these methods to problems with multiple objectives.

supervisor3@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor3,Auto tuning the machine learning model parameters with multi-objective optimisation,"Many parametric machine learning models e.g., neural networks and random forest have many parameters which need to be pre-fixed. These parameters are usually specified with some trial and error. In this project, you will use a multi-objective optimisation approach to get these parameter values by achieving multiple objectives simultaneously. These multiple objectives can be minimising time, maximising accuracy, minimising overfitting and minimising complexity. These objectives are typically conflicting in nature and therefore, needs a multi-objective optimisation method to achieve them. You will use the multi-objective optimisation approach on different models and different data sets. You will also validate the resulting model on the unseen data.

In the last few decades, wind farms having wind turbines have been used to harness the energy. You will join the team of India-UK collaboration project on wind farm optimisation and learn how to solve real-world optimisation problems with conflicting objectives. It is an excellent opportunity for students with background in machine learning and optimisation. You will be applying optimisation techniques and methods with machine learning models such as Random forest and Gaussian processes. 

In this project, you will optimise the location and number of wind turbines in a given wind farm to achieve two objectives: maximising the power and minimising the cost. The optimisation problem has two more challenges: 1) constraint of a minimum distance between turbines and 2) uncertainty coming from the wind speed and directions because of different weather conditions and seasons.

supervisor4@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor4,"Networked narratives, framing and culture wars","Narratives are the stories we tell about the world. They are the way we connect new information to our preexisting beliefs and opinions. For instance, two people might read the same news article about how the government handled an important issue, and one might say the article shows how their government is incompetent, while the other person might say the article is biased, and their government is actually doing a fantastic job. Both might interpret the article differently, each reinforcing different combinations of beliefs and opinions they might hold -- and ultimately, different sets of narratives -- about the world.

The aim of this project is to apply tools from machine learning, natural language processing, and social network analysis to look at the networks of narratives around particular political topics, as put together by politicians and other influential figures on social media and parliamentary speeches. Data is available through public archives such as Hansard (UK parliament) and the ParlSpeech Dataverse (multiple countries), as well as from individual countries' parliamentary archives. There is also the possibility of scraping Twitter data if it is relevant.

Examples of questions include seeing how the framing around an issue changed over time: for instance, how different politicians describe particular countries as allied or enemies, and whether particular stances (pro-this, against-that) are often expressed together. Another possibility is to study how different politicians/parliaments/governments reacted to the same topics (e.g. COVID-19, vaccines, misinformation), or to try to identify networks of co-occurring narratives by tracking stories that are told by the same people in the same time span.

In addition to providing a good opportunity for the development and application of natural language processing and data science tools, this project should make a contribution to fields such as computational social science, political communication, framing and agenda setting.","keywords: natural language processing, social network analysis, machine learning"
supervisor4@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor4,Pandemic science and the construction of knowledge,"Keeping up with the scientific literature on any field is usually a very difficult task. In 2020, this became particularly true for scholars trying to understand the COVID-19 pandemic.
In an effort to help parse the thousands of papers on COVID-19, the White House and a coalition of research groups prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 100,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. Kaggle tasks were produced, machine learning was deployed, summary tables were compiled, describing the scientific literature on the pandemic, and all seems to have worked quite well.

Now that the urgency of the first wave of the pandemic has passed, it is time to analyse what is left: hundreds of thousands of papers, in multiple fields, with variable relevance to the topic, and very variable contributions to the study of the pandemic. Many of these papers never left pre-print stage, given the context where they were produced -- where speed and spread were sometimes prioritised over contribution.

The aim of this project is to apply tools from machine learning and natural language processing to study the papers in the CORD-19 dataset. Some possible questions involve identifying clusters of similar papers in the dataset, and perhaps the core scientific contributions in every cluster. Another avenue is to investigate whether the COVID-19 papers build on top of each other, or whether they are mostly standalone papers citing pre-pandemic literature. Is it possible to identify if these papers are different in any meaningful way from papers not discussing COVID-19? Are they shorter, or more focused? Are there more people ""jumping on the bandwagon"" just because the topic is trending, or perhaps more collaboration across disciplines? There are multiple avenues to explore.

In addition to providing a good opportunity for the development and application of natural language processing and data science tools, this project should make a contribution to fields such as computational humanities, computational social science, cultural analytics, cultural evolution, scientometrics and sociology of science.

supervisor4@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor4,The anatomy of a scientific field,"Language is one of the most complex of human traits. In trying to understand it, the field of evolutionary linguistics has produced multiple hypotheses about how languages originated, what factors shaped their diversity, and what ongoing processes drive how they change. Many of these hypotheses have been collected and catalogued in CHIELD -- the Causal Hypotheses in Evolutionary Linguistics Database. CHIELD is a searchable database that works as a tool for expressing, exploring, evaluating, comparing and contrasting hypotheses. It also serves as a fossil record of the evolution of evolutionary linguistics as a field.

The aim of this project is to apply tools from machine learning and network science to study the evolution of the CHIELD dataset. There are multiple questions to be answered here, from which hypotheses are most robust or more often validated (or which hypotheses have been debunked), and more broadly, what evolutionary linguistics looks like, over time. Moreover, given that CHIELD is a massive network involving hypotheses, authors, and papers, there are many questions about whether there are any clusters/communities of hypotheses, whether any ""phase transition"" like a giant component can happen in this network and what that means.

In addition to providing a good opportunity for the development and application of data science tools, this project should make a contribution to fields such as computational humanities, computational social science, cultural analytics, cultural evolution, scientometrics and sociology of science, as well as evolutionary linguistics itself.","keywords: natural language processing, social network analysis, machine learning"

Undetected plagiarism."" -- If you open your mobile app store and search for ""Flappy Bird"", you might not find the original game anymore, but you will still find endless variations on the theme, from Sloppy Bird to Flap The Bird. This is no surprise: copies, rip-offs, tributes, and plagiarism are at the heart of many creative industries. The same happens for TV, movies and other media which are full of narrative conventions and story devices, all of which can be copied and adapted.

Most notably, many of these story conventions have been catalogued in the wiki website TV Tropes, which collects and documents descriptions and examples of media tropes in television, film, literature, comics, anime, manga, video games, music, advertisements, as well as some non-media subjects such as history, geography, and politics -- containing everything from the Evil Twin trope seen in so many movies to the ""30-Day Free Trial!"" catchphrase in advertising.

The aim of this project is to apply tools from machine learning, natural language processing, and network science to a dataset corresponding to one of these media, and ask questions such as: what are the categories we can infer from this data? How are tropes distributed over genre? What makes a genre, and do genres change over time? What can we say about tropes that have disappeared, or emerged recently? How much mimicry and plagiarism is there? How can we effectively measure all these concepts?

supervisor5@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor5,Organising Dependencies in Teaching Material,"Teaching material can come in various forms, i.e., texts for self-study, pre-recorded videos, exercises (which might have solutions). There are various relations between these different types of teaching material, e.g., an exercise might only make sense if, beforehand, a certain text of video has been studied.

Moreover, teaching material is usually split into smaller blocks that might depend on each other or that provide optional further study material, introducing another type of dependencies.

In this project, a tool should be developed that allows the analysis of dependencies of teaching material and that allows to create guidance to the learner what part of a course/module should be consumed in which order (and what parts are, e.g., optional or for further study, i.e., could be skipped first).

Overall, the problem shares similarities with resolving software dependencies, as done by common package managers (e.g., npm for nodejs or apt for Debian/Ubuntu). Thus, one solution to the problem is encoding the dependencies as a satisfiability problem and then using a SAT or SMT solver.

Ultimately, we want to develop an approach that allows us to provide mathematical guarantees for programs written in Go, which are required for highly safety or security critical systems.

Besides the fact that Go’s concurrency model is inspired by a well-established formalism, another motivation for this project is the TamaGo, a bare metal Go for ARM processors.

The resulting algorithms can be used in smartwatches for fitness tracking. Focus will be on classifying movements as rotations or translations, using generalized-likelihood ratio tests. A biceps curl, for example, should be close to a pure rotation, whereas a shoulder press should be close to a pure translation. This is very similar to how inertial sensors are used to detect zero-velocity instances in foot-mounted inertial navigation. The results of these classifications can then be used to make a more fine-grained exercise classification by analysing the direction of these movements.",

We can then use machine learning algorithms to assess the similarity between these executions and those of less experienced individuals when doing the same exercises, and thereby get an assessment of their technique.

supervisor6@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor6,Covariance adaptation in foot-mounted inertial navigation  ,The idea of foot-mounted inertial navigation is to compute position estimates by integrating measurements from inertial sensors and applying so-called zero-velocity updates to constrain the position drift whenever the foot is stationary. A zero-velocity detector is used to identify the sampling instances when the foot is stationary. One potential shortcoming of the zero-velocity model is the binary decision made by the zero-velocity detector (stationary/moving). The aim of this project is to investigate methods for replacing this binary output with a continuous output that is used to scale the covariance matrix of the zero-velocity updates.,

Abstract: Person re-identification is defined as the problem of recognizing an individual captured in diverse times and/or locations over several nonoverlapping camera views, considering a large set of candidates. This problem affects primarily the management of distributed, multiview surveillance systems, in which subjects must be tracked across different places, either a posteriori or on-the-fly when they move through different locations. Re-identification is a very difficult problem, as most of the time people can be captured by several low resolution cameras, under occlusion conditions, badly (and different from view to view) illuminated, and in varying poses. In this context, a robust modeling of the entire body appearance of a person is necessary, especially when other classical biometric cues (face, gait) are not available or difficult to catch, due to the sensors’ scarce resolution or low frame-rate. This chapter gives an overview of the re-identification problem, illustrating the standard re-identification pipeline and detailing the several approaches and techniques, devoting more attention to those which have shown to be particularly effective and significant.

Abstract: Can you count crowds appearing in a concert? Due to its variety of applications in the real-world, counting a large population from a single view has received a lot of interest in recent years. However, this is extremely tedious to manually count crowds just from a single view. Therefore, to alleviate this difficulty in counting, in this project, we will develop automatic software based on computer vision algorithms that can count crowds from a single view or photograph. Specifically, we will learn several deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, autoencoders etc and work with them to design an artificial neural network that can automatically calculate numbers in a given photograph.

Abstract: Correctly identifying a specific flower is often considered as a very challenging task, because many of them can be significantly alike, such as “digitate” and “setosa” which only have very minor differences in their appearance. In this project, we will develop computer vision techniques to automatically separate those similarly looking flower species from their photos. We will use computer vision algorithms to learn fine grained features of flowers that can distinguish them. Further to the main aim of the project, we also intend to use a minimum amount of supervision to learn those fine grained features of flowers. Specifically, we will learn several deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, autoencoders etc and work with them to design an artificial neural network that can distinguish flowers via their fine grained features.

supervisor10@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor10,Compositional Zero-shot Learning,"Keywords: category-state recognition, computer vision, language

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL) requires recognition of state-object compositions unseen during training. Instead of assuming prior knowledge about the unseen compositions, we operate in the open world setting, where the search space includes a large number of unseen compositions some of which might be unfeasible. In this setting, we start from the cosine similarity between visual features and compositional embeddings. After estimating the feasibility score of each composition, we use these scores to either directly mask the output space or as a margin for the cosine similarity between visual features and compositional embeddings during training. Our experiments on two standard CZSL benchmarks show that all the methods suffer severe performance degradation when applied in the open world setting. While our simple CZSL model achieves state-of-the-art performances in the closed world scenario, our feasibility scores boost the performance of our approach in the open world setting, clearly outperforming the previous state of the art.

DRL can automatically learn an optimal policy (i.e., a mapping from environment states to actions) through interacting with the environment to maximize a numerical reward signal. The value-based DRL methods are widely used to solve real-world problems, with the aim of obtaining the optimal value function. This project will investigate value-based DRL methods and evaluate their performances in different environments (e.g., Atari games).

FL decouples the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data centrally. In FL, each user locally trains a shared model by using their own data, and only uploads the parameters of the model to the central server for aggregation. This process can greatly protect users’ privacy and largely reduce communication costs. This project will investigate the performance of FL for various tasks (recommendation, classification, etc) in terms of test accuracy by simulations and/or experiments using TensorFlow.

The potential benefits from SDN have been attracting significant attentions from both the academia and industry. The students who are interested in this topic are highly recommended to read this survey paper: D. Kreutz, et al., Software-Defined Networking: A Comprehensive Survey, Proceedings of the IEEE, vo. 103, no. 1, pp. 14-76, 2015.

One of the interesting ways of adopting SDN is to program network behaviour following any ideas you may have, e.g., the customised protocols that are suitable to your business. With SDN, the production life-cycle of a new protocol can be significantly shortened, i.e., no need of protocol standardisation or implementation in a dedicated device. Instead, you can readily implement the protocols in a standard server/PC. Upon completion of the project, students are expected to propose a new model/algorithm that hasn't been standardised and implement your proposal through SDN paradigm to allow the network behave as you desire.",

In-network caching is widely used in ICNs to improve network performance by keeping frequently accessed information in a location closer to the requester. However, the caching capacity in network nodes is relatively small in comparison to the amount of content being forwarded. Therefore, how to reduce caching redundancy and increase the utilisation of cache resources becomes paramount importance. This project targets at these critical questions and focuses on the development of new caching algorithms for in-network caches in ICNs. Upon completion of the project, the students are expected to have a deep understanding of the ICN, evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art caching algorithms on ICNs, and propose innovative algorithms to improve the in-network caching performance.

Here, it would be interesting to compare a classifier based on combining multiple classifiers, each based on their own sensor, with the approach of fusing all measurements in one “big” classifier. It would also be of interest to evaluate the benefit of using classification features based on standard computational metrics in inertial navigation, such as integrated measurements and the output from zero-velocity classifiers.

supervisor22@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor22,Chairity on the Blockchain,"A decentralized application (DApp) is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system. DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as the Ethereum blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts.

In this project you will develop a DApp for the Ethereum blockchain which supports transparent donations for chairities.

To this end you will first elicite requirements for the project and design the high level architecture. You will then implement the system as Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity.","With this project you will learn a lot about Blockchain, an emerging and increasingly popular technology. In particular you will learn a lot about the Ethereum blockchain which is one of the most popular ones."
supervisor23@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor23,Machine Learning for ICU mortality and outcome prediction ,"Outcome and mortality prediction of hospitalised patients is an important problem. Over the past few decades, several severity scoring systems and machine learning mortality prediction models have been developed for predicting hospital mortality. This project aims to develop machine learning models for outcome prediction in Intensive Care units using the MIMIC database and PhysioNet Challenges datasets.","https://physionet.org/content/widsdatathon2020/1.0.0/

supervisor24@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor24,Machine learning for digital marketing and recommender systems,"The market share of online/e-commerce sales has been rapidly increasing during the last three decades. In 2018, for the first time, the amount of total online sales has exceeded the in-store sales in the USA. Moreover, Google and Facebook generated 116.3 and 55.8  billion US dollars respectively in 2018 from online advertising only. Unlike in-store sales, digital marketing and online sales generate big and valuable data about products, consumers' engagement and behaviour which was not available for business before (e.g. where customers are coming from? what devices they are using? what items do they buy? or view and for how long? how shoppers respond to digital marketing ads and emails? and much more). Moreover, social media has changed how companies advertise their products, engage with potential consumers and understand market segments needs. This project aims to develop machine learning methods for digital marketing and recommender systems using publicly available datasets i.e. https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html",

supervisor25@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor25,Constructing aggregation units for geospatial analyses,"When analysing geospatial data, we often need to build spatial aggregation units. In this project, we build a method to create these units, then use different data sets to compare the method against standard approaches.",
supervisor25@exeter.ac.uk,supervisor25,GAN to create camouflage patterns,Traditionally a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to create realistic examples of particular classes of images.  The generator creates example images and then the discriminator tries to spot the fakes.  This project will investigate getting the generator to create camouflage patterns to hide objects in images and the discriminator will try to spot the camouflaged objects.,
